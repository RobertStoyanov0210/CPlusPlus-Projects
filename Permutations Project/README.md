# CPlusPlus-Projects
My first C++ project

- Introduction:

I finished my first semester with this project. It covers the whole material studied until then and it is based on
the basics of permutations.

- IDE:

  Visual Studio 2017

- How to run it:

In "Source Files", you need to add: main.cpp, Subset.cpp, SubsetEx12.cpp

In "Header Files", you need: Subset.h, HeaderEx12.h

- Test:

Cols: 5

{0 , 0}: 1

{0 , 1}: 4

{0 , 2}: 3

{0 , 3}: 2

{0 , 4}: 11

Here you can choose between controlling the next generation of numbers(enter 2) or try random generation(enter 1).

If you entered 2:

{1 , 0}: 4

{1 , 1}: 1

{1 , 2}: 2

{1 , 3}: 3

{1 , 4}: 11

And now you can try the example given there, or try these:

(1234)(1,3,5)   
(0)(123)(1,2,3)   
(12345)(1,2,3,4,5)

This shows how the elements are linked. For example: (1234)(1,2,3) -> 1234 is connected to itself; 1 is connected to 2; 2 to 3 and 3 to 1.
